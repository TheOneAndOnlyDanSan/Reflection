# Reflection

### ... because Java Reflection kind of sucks

### ... and this library makes it suck a little less.

Including:

1. Helper methods to get Fields, Methods and Constructors.

2. Change values of fields, invoke methods and create new instances by invoking constructors.

3. Methods to explicitly box and unbox primitives, and to deal with primitive and wrappers.

4. Support for accessing "Inaccessible" objects which would result in an InaccessibleObjectException when accessing with regular reflection.
